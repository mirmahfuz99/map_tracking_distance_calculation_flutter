  Title: Real-time Map Tracking and Distance Calculation

  Core Functions
  - Marking Points: Upon clicking "Start Tracking," the app marks the user's current location as Point A.
  - Real-time Tracking: As the user moves, the application fetches updated location data and draws a visible path in a different color between Point A and their current location.
  - Destination Marking: To mark Point B long press is required on map.
  - Distance Calculation: Once Point B is set, the application calculates the distance between Point A and Point B and displays it to the user.

  Test Cases
  - App requests location permissions appropriately.
  - App accurately tracks device location.
  - Point A and Point B are marked correctly.
